One clue is if the email address of the sending or receiving party reads like it is from a rescue, or the sending or receiving party has a website. If a transport request is for multiple animals the probability you are transporting pets is slight.  However, there are times you are transporting pets for good reason, such as transporting service animals, or an animal from a rescue to adopters who will be the animal\'s forever home. There are hardship cases such as the transport of pets for people in our military, or a disabled pet being accepted into a sanctuary.

That will catch and absorb the worst of it.  Every towel is washed prior to reuse whether it was soiled or not.  At the receiving end of the flight, take all the "linens" and place them in a plastic garbage bag and close it tightly. That way you don\'t have to enjoy the aromas on the return flight. If the crate gets soiled you can use the hose that every FBO seems to have available and flush it out before the return flight.  The crate will not be perfectly clean for reuse, but at least you have flushed away the worst soiling.',

A no-slip collar or harness is preferred.  Shopping bags serve well for "picking up" after them or you can use special doggy waste bags.  Remember the pavement will be extremely hot in high temperatures.  If possible, carry them or have lineserve grab a golf cart and drive them to the lobby or a grass area in hot weather.',
	),
	array(
		0 => 'Are there any problems with tethering animals, such as chewing, fighting, or getting loose?',
		1 => 'I would suggest never transporting tethered animals who are not familiar with each or used to sharing a confined space together. This is not the time or place to introduce them.  Any hostility between dogs prior to a flight where they will be tethered is reason to leave one behind or cancel altogether.  It is also important to ask your rescue contact when transporting if any of the animals are in season. You may need to consider this when transporting animals of opposite genders.  I would also suggest that you use an approved auto safety harness and fit it snugly to the animal. These clasp directly into your back seat belts and though the pup has some room to shift around, they will not end up in your lap. Or use a short leash (3 feet or less) and loop the handle of the leash through the seat belt retainers and slip the end of the leash through the leash handle - then clip it to the harness once the dog is loaded. Tethering with a chain avoids the problem of chewing through a leash.  Some pilots prefer only to fly with dogs contained in hard-sided crates.  It is better to err on the side of caution, especially if you fly alone.  We urge pilots to make decisions with their safety and the safety of the flight foremost in their minds.',

	array(
		0 => 'What breeds have more trouble with extreme temperatures?',
		1 => 'Certain types of dogs are more sensitive to heat - especially obese dogs and brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds, like Pugs and Bulldogs. Use extreme caution when these dogs are exposed to heat.  The same is true of short-nosed cats like Persians.  Short-snouted animals can also have difficulty breathing in very cold weather as well. Limited time on the tarmac is best. They should be fine in the aircraft with good ventilation. Always keep in mind it is warmer in a crate!',
	),
	array(
		0 => 'How can I keep the animals cool in hot weather?',
		1 => 'There are several ways you can help keep the animals you are transporting cool. Most FBO\'s are air conditioned and many will allow pets inside, or keep them in the rescue volunteer\'s air conditioned car until you are ready to load them onto the plane. If an air conditioned area is not available, a shady area off the hot tarmac is another choice. Please remember to use a non-slip collar or harness for all dogs you are walking. With snub-nosed dogs, be aware that they need additional precautions in hot weather and cold. For hot weather, a covered cool pac can be placed in the crate with the animal. Be sure this is in a zip lock bag and covered with an absorbent towel. You can also use a small battery operated fan set in front of the crate. A cool pac can be placed between the fan and the crate to allow cool air to flow through the crate. Immediately upon arrival remove the animal from the crate and take them to a cool area. Always make sure there is plenty of air flow in the cabin. The temps are much higher inside the crate than the surrounding area in the cabin. If possible use a crate one size larger than normal with ventilation on all 4 sides for snub-nosed animals.  If the weather is exceptionally cold, keep the animal in a warm area until boarding and include a small towel or blanket in their crate. Shredded newspaper works as well, as it is absorbent and the animals can "nest" in the paper.',

		0 => 'Does Pilots N Paws have an official FAA call sign?',
		1 => 'No, not at this time.  The problem is the FAA has no way of verifying we have sufficient monthly activity since we are a bulletin board and we do not require reporting of completed flights. We likely have significantly more transports than required by the regs, but until we make some modifications to our website we cannot document the numbers.  Though PNP does not have its own call sign, you are permitted to use the Compassion call sign because we are a member of Air Care Alliance, should you so desire.',
	),
	array(
		0 => 'Should animals be sedated for the flight?',
		1 => 'Sedating animals is a decision best left to the veterinarians. Almost all animals that are vocal when loaded quiet down and sleep once the plane is running or airborne. Occasionally an animal will bark or yelp or make noises. It is probably not necessary to sedate an animal unless it has some type of behaviour problems or is easily scared. Often talking in a soothing voice to the animal relaxes the animal.',
