Private pilots usually only fly about 300 nautical miles and should not be expected to land and refuel and continue on. There are exceptions, but this is a guideline. Long transports need to be broken down into legs of about 300 miles each. This requires pilots to coordinate their schedules and meet at airports to transport the pet on the next leg. The longer the flight, the more connections needed. You must allow for contingencies such as weather delays or mechanical problems, so you should arrange temporary foster for the animal at each connecting point in case of an unexpected layover.  Ground transport or commercial air transport will be better alternatives for many long distance transports.',

Please have the necessary paperwork that is accompanying the animal and a collar and leash supplied. Some pilots will want the pet to be crated.
