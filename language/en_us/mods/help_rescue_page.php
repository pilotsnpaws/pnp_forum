A request that is marked "Done" on the forum serves as documentation that the transport was completed through Pilots N Paws. So even though it is easier to skip posting and contact pilots you know directly, it is important to post your request on the forum so they have documentation for tax purposes. Remember, even a short flight costs them hundreds of dollars. Many are doing frequent flights, and some also do long haul flights.

Private pilots usually only fly about 300 nautical miles and should not be expected to land and refuel and continue on. There are exceptions, but this is a guideline. Long transports need to be broken down into legs of about 300 miles each. This requires pilots to coordinate their schedules and meet at airports to transport the pet on the next leg. The longer the flight, the more connections needed. You must allow for contingencies such as weather delays or mechanical problems, so you should arrange temporary foster for the animal at each connecting point in case of an unexpected layover.

Please have the necessary paperwork that is accompanying the animal and a collar and leash supplied. Some pilots will want the pet to be crated.  A rabies certificate (if the dog is old enough) and a health certificate are necessary to cross state lines in most states .  Check the requirements for each state the flight will pass through.
